description: How to acquire fluency in linguistic skills like programming.
summary: With apologies to Star Trek fans, these are my ideas on how linguistic fluency is acquired.  I have pretty much taken them from Stephen Krashen's theories on Language Acquisition, but have modified them slightly based on my own experiences as a language teacher. This is important as I believe it is the key to teaching programmers how to program more fluently.

## How Can We Improve Programming Fluency?

In my discussion on [language acquisition](../LanguageAcquisition),
I make the case that programming has much in common with
linguistic skills like speaking a language.  The problems
one encounters with language acquisition are very similar
to the problems one encounters with improving fluency
in programming.  Here, I list a number of rules for
acquiring fluency in literary skills.

This information is
based on theories from an American researcher called
[Stephen Krashen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Krashen).  His
research is not without critics and quite a few of his ideas are 
unsubstantiated by scientific verification (which is notoriously difficult
in this field).  However, his ideas form the most [comprehensive framework
for understanding acquisition](http://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash.html)
that I have encountered.  I have also used
many of these ideas in the classroom with considerable success.

### Rule 1: "Acquisition" and "Learning" are different
The first rule of acquisition is that *acquisition* and *learning* are
different.  Most people are familiar with learning, as it is the predominate
method used in schools.  When you learn something you can recall it based
on some stimulus.  Acquisition is slightly different.  If you acquire
something, you can use it in a complex situation without prior planning.

Let me give you an example.  If you see an apple, 
the word “apple” springs to mind unbidden.  Similarly, when you read the 
word apple you automatically make the association to your internal 
concept of an apple without any effort. In fact, it's practically 
impossible to stop yourself from making those associations.  They are automatic.
Could you read the world "apple" *without* understanding it?

On the other hand, when you learn a word you can remember the meaning, but
there is no direct link between the word itself and its
concept.  Instead, you usually translate the word to your native language.
If I said that "ringo" means "apple" in Japanese, it is quite easy 
to remember the meaning whenever you see "ringo".  However, until you 
acquire the word, just looking at "ringo" does not automatically make 
you think about an apple (you may, instead, start thinking of a drummer 
from the 1960s).

The difference is important because if something is learned, rather than
acquired, considerable amount of planning is required to choose appropriate
constructs.  For example, you can make a *reservation* for a table at a
restaurant, but you must make an *appointment* with your doctor.  If you
have acquired these expressions, the correct one will appear in your
mind without effort.  If you have simply learned the expressions, you will
have to think carefully about which one is most appropriate.

### Rule 2: Your "Monitor" warns of bad smells.
The second rule of acquisition is that there is something called a
"monitor" which tells you when input is acceptable or unacceptable.
For example, if I type "appel" you will immediately recognize that
this is an incorrect spelling of "apple".  Language that is acquired
will spring from the mind without planning, but people still make
mistakes.  The monitor tells you whether or not the language is
appropriate in the current context.

The monitor is often used by fluent speakers to correct themselves,
but it is not a rule based approach.  It is a feeling that you
get when patterns aren't matching they way you expect.  If I say,
"Me and my friend went to London yesterday," hopefully you will
immediately get the feeling that something is wrong.  You may not
know consciously that "me" is used to denote the object of a verb
and can't be used as the subject of the sentence.  However, something
"smells bad" in the sentence.  The more you have acquired English
grammer, the more likely you will find these bad smells, even if you
don't know the explicit rules of grammar.

### Rule 3: Acquisition comes from "comprehensible input"
The third rule of acquisition is that acquisition comes *not* from
creating output (as one might expect), but rather from understanding
input.  Every time we are given input that we understand, we strengthen
the associations between the language and the concept.  Furthermore
Krashen's Input Hypothesis states that acquisition *only* comes as
a result of comprehensible input.  In other words, no matter what
activity we are partaking in, acquisition of language comes only from
our understanding of that language.

This is an incredibly divisive point, but I think it is true.  As long
as you can remember the language (which is an important issue that
Krashen does not discuss), acquisition comes from understanding the language.
Even if you are creating your own ouput, acquisition of that language
comes from your own understanding of the language, not in the planning
activities that formed the language in the first place.

The most important point to realize is that acquisition *only* occurs if
the person *understands* the input.  Simply looking at or listening to input is
is not sufficient.  Similarly, the process of understanding the input
is important.  My experience has been that people who are told the meaning
of something without making an effort to understand, never acquire it.

### Rule 4: Output rules are generated from input.
The fourth rule of acquisition is that input which is understood generates
the rules necessary to create similar output.  These rules are not specific
rules, as output does not require planning.  Rather they are
fuzzy associations in our brain.  When we wish to communicate something,
language constructs come out based on these associations if we have acquired
the language.  Our monitors may edit the output as appropriate, though
(this is frequent when writing, for example).  The rules which we create
are never compelete.  As we acquire the language, these rules are
modified and strengthened.  Thus, to create output, we need to be given
a lot of input in many different contexts.

### Rule 5: Correction is usually helpful
The fifth rule of acquisition is that correction of output is usually
helpful when someone is acquiring language.  The problem is that we
never have a full understanding of language.  Even if we fully understand
a sentence, we may not fully understand the most appropriate
circumstance in which to use the sentence, etc.  As a person learns,
their output will be based on incomplete rules and so they will make
mistakes.  Their monitor is also not functioning at a high level and
so they won't realize their mistakes.  Having a fluent speaker model
the correct output is extremely useful in acquisition.

Krashen has said that he does not believe that correction is necessary
in language acquisition.  I will defer to his experience, but I believe
that learners are constantly testing their output.  If someone creates
a lot of output without correction, there is a risk that they will
begin to acquire their own language constructs rather than those of
the population around them.  It is therefore very important for learners
who generate a lot of output to have their output corrected.

### Rule 6: Memory is necessary for acquisition

This is an issue that, as far as I know, is not addressed by Krashen.
Acquisition requires sufficient exposure to language.  If the
exposure is not frequent enough, the person will not remember
and acquisition will never occur.  Not only must the person be exposed
enough, but they must be exposed at regular intervals.  It is also
very possible to forget something that has been acquired.  This happens
frequently to people who stop using their mother tongue and lose
the ability to speak in that language.
