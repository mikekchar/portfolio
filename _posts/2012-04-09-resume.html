    <p class="para"> 
    I am software developer with nearly 20 years of professional experience.
    I have spent many years working in a senior technical role, but I enjoy
    exercising my people skills as much as my technical skills.  In fact,
    I have spent the last 5 years teaching English to high school students
    in Japan, while writing free software in my spare time.  I am looking
    to return to a software related position in a way that allows me to
    exercise both my technical and communication expertise.

          I am a member of the JET programme which is a cultural exchange
          program with the government of Japan. The JET programme aims
          to promote internationalization by inviting overseas graduates
          to assist in international exchange and foreign language education.
          As a member of the English department at Sagara High School in
          Shizuoka prefecture, I am required to teach communication
          classes to students aged from 15 to 18 years old.  A senior
          teacher often attends my classes, but I usually create lesson
          plans, teach the class and evaluate the students independently.
          I use a mixture of both English and Japanese in my job, but I have
          taught classes entirely in Japanese or English depending on
          the situation.
          </p>
          <p>
          I had originally intended to stay a single year in order to improve
          my Japanese and gain some teaching experience.  The position was
          so rewarding that I ended up accepting the offer to stay for the
          maximum 5 year period.  In order to keep my software skills somewhat
          current, I developed an application, JLDrill, to help people
          study the Japanese language.  JLDrill was developed in Ruby and
          GTK+, using rspec as a BDD platform.  JLDrill is free software
          and I have highlighted various aspects of its development in my
          portfolio.

          Reporting to the development director for most of my
          tenure, I performed a role similar to a SCRUM leader
          or XP coach.  I was assigned to various teams
		  but did not report directly to the team's
		  manager.  My accountability was the improvement of the
		  team's performance, to the development of the product.
		  Working with the manager of each team, I helped implement
		  processes that would improve performance.  I also spent a great
		  deal of my time mentoring development members.  As I tried to
		  work by example, I took on a development load of about
          50%.  I also compiled weekly metrics showing our 
          development improvements.

		  <li class="project">
		    Corel Graphigo.  A sketching tool with automatic
			shape recognition written for Tablet PCs.  Written in C# and
			C++.  This project used a full blown Extreme Programming
			process.  We went from nothing to ~80,000 lines of code in 5
			months with between 4 and 6 programmers.  When it was
			shipped, there were only 12 bugs logged.  This product
			received the Comdex Best of Show award when it was released.

		  <li class="project">
		    Smart Graphics Studio.  A product used to visualise
		    data.  The user draws representations of the final output
		    using an SVG drawing tool.  He then indicates areas of the
			graphic that are to be "dynamic".  These dynamic areas are
			mapped to data.  An XSLT code generator is used to generate
			transformations from the data to the picture.  A widget
			library written in JavaScript is used to provide interactivity
			to the resultant project.  Developed in C++, XSLT and
			JavaScript this was a complex project involving 20 developers
			and 20 other staff.  Development was done using a variant of
			the SCRUM methodology.

          have been obliged to pay for.  The second

          reduced the utilisation of trunks during certain types of
          forwarded calls.  This feature reached over $20 million in
