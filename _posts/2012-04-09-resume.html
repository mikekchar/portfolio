        <h2>Professional Objective</h2>
        <p> 
        I am software developer with nearly 20 years of professional 
        experience.  I have spent many years working in a senior 
        technical role, but I enjoy exercising my people skills as 
        much as my technical skills.  In fact, I have spent the 
        last 5 years teaching English to high school students
        in Japan, while writing free software in my spare time.  
        I am looking to return to a software related position in 
        a way that allows me to exercise both my technical and 
        communication expertise.

            I was a member of the JET programme which is a cultural exchange
            program with the government of Japan. The JET programme aims
            to promote internationalisation by inviting overseas graduates
            to assist in international exchange and foreign language education.
            As a member of the English department at Sagara High School in
            Shizuoka prefecture, I was required to teach communication
            classes to students aged from 15 to 18 years old.  A senior
            teacher often attended my classes, but I usually created lesson
            plans, taught the classes and evaluated the students independently.
            I used a mixture of both English and Japanese in my job, but I have
            taught classes entirely in Japanese or English depending on
            the situation.
            </p>
            <p>
            I had originally intended to stay a single year in order to improve
            my Japanese and gain some teaching experience.  The position was
            so rewarding that I ended up accepting the offer to stay for the
            maximum 5 year period.  In order to keep my software skills somewhat
            current, I developed an application, JLDrill, to help people
            study the Japanese language.  JLDrill was developed in Ruby and
            GTK+, using rspec as a BDD platform.  JLDrill is free software
            and I am currently documenting various aspects of its development 
            in my portfolio (not yet available).

        <div class="description">
            <p>
            Object World provided a unified communications system for small
            to medium sized companies based on the Microsoft Windows OS
            platform.  The goal of unified communications is to place all
            communications infrastructure under a single technology rather
            than to have separate computing and telephony infrastructures.
            The main product, UC Server, integrated several 3rd party
            technologies such as SIP PBXs, SIP telephones, Active Directory, etc.
            My role was to provide SIP expertise to the team, though I
            worked on various aspects of the product using C++.  In the 
            latter half, I was responsible for maintaining the integrated 
            SIP PBX, which was written in Java.
            </p>
            <p>
            In addition to programming I also introduced appropriate
            process improvements to the team.  The most important of these
            was probably the adoption of planning and tracking techniques
            similar to Scrum's Planning Poker or XP's Planning Game.  I
            also encouraged the consolidation of both feature and bug
            tracking using the existing Bugzilla tool and built an
            XSLT tool to scrape data from Bugzilla and automatically
            produce a burn down chart on demand.  I implemented
            a continuous build system and introduced the concept
            of continuous integration to the team.  Finally, I modified
            the release processes so that program managers would have
            a stable build with which to demonstrate new product capabilities
            on a weekly basis.

            Reporting to the development director for most of my
            tenure, I performed a role similar to a Scrum master
            or XP coach.  I was assigned to various teams
            but did not report directly to the team's
            manager.  I was accountable for the improvement of the
            team's performance, not the development of the product.
            Working with the manager of each team, I helped implement
            processes that would improve performance.  I also spent a great
            deal of my time mentoring development members.  As I tried to
            work by example, I took on a development load of about
            50%.  I also compiled weekly metrics showing our 
            development improvements.

            In this role, I actively took part in feature and code
            change reviews.  As part of my role I introduced a process
            which added the use of code and design reviews for all code
            changes within the group.

            I designed and implemented two features.  The first reduced
            the size of code in the product which helped avoid the need
            for memory upgrades to customers' switches, something for 
            which Nortel would have been obliged to pay.  The second
            feature was Release Link Trunk for PRI.  This feature
            reduced the utilisation of trunks during certain types of
            forwarded calls.  This feature reached over $20 million in
            sales in the first year.  These features were implemented in
            Protel-2 and XPM-Pascal.

            As a member of the software consulting team, I provided
            specialised application development services to Bell
            Northern Research.  In this capacity, I aided the PRI
            legacy team in refactoring its code so that pieces could
            be moved from one layer to another.  This also had the benefit of
            reducing the number of individual releases that contained
            PRI code.  To facilitate the work, I built a web-based
            software architecture visualisation tool using perl.

            Ubitrex was a company that created one of the first
            health care information systems with computerised point
            of care information gathering.  The system allowed doctors
            to visualise patient information and plan care for the
            patents.  This plan was displayed on a wireless portable
            terminal which also allowed nurses to enter patient information.
            Ubitrex Corporation was later bought and changed it's name
            to Continental Health Care.
            </p>
            <p>
            I originally worked on the portable terminal.  This consisted
            of embedded C code on the terminal and C++ networking code
            on Sun Workstations. Because Ubitrex was a start up company
            that experienced rapid growth, the software processes were
            initially ad hoc and eventually caused productivity problems.
            As part of the development team, I researched software development
            practices and helped implement an interactive process using
            Wirfs-Brock use case analysis and OMT object modelling.  We also
            implemented very strict code reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
            In 1993 and 1994 we introduced a new hardware platform for the
            portable terminal using a pen based interface and radio LAN.
            We took the opportunity to rewrite the terminal software and
            I was responsible for its initial design.
            I also ported the workstation code from BSD based Sun OS to Sys V
            based Solaris.  This included moving from the C front based
            C++ compiler to Sun's native compiler.

            While still a student at the University, I worked a mixture
            of full time and part time in various departments.  I took a
            year off in 1988 to concentrate on my studies.

            In 1986 and 1987 I wrote a full screen terminal
            emulator in FORTH that ran on various PC platforms.  It provided
            full screen editing capabilities for the MVS mainframe.

            In 1989, I worked for the physics department 
            maintaining the data collection library in C for the time 
            of flight mass spectrometer.  I also wrote a scientific 
            graphing program to visualize the data.

            <p>
            In 1990 and 1991, I worked for the astronomy
            department where I implemented the display and database
            for a telescope simulation on the Macintosh in C.
            Later I wrote a 3D starfield animation system for
            the planetarium in object oriented FORTH.
