	</h2>

	<p class="para"> 
	  As a programmer with over 15 years of experience,
	  I have spent many years working through others in senior
	  technical roles.  I have always endeavoured to bring the teams 
	  I have been on to the highest possible level.  I influence
	  others through example and enjoy using my mentoring skills.
	  Lately I have been working in a position that puts emphasis
	  mainly on my technical abilities.  While I find this quite
	  satisfying, I am eager to find an opportunity that will allow 
	  me to marry my technical experience and people skills in a
	  dynamic and constructive way.

          Reporting to the development director for most of my
		  tenure, I played an unusual role in this group.  I was assigned
		  to a team, but did not report directly to the team's
		  manager.  My accountability was to the improvement of the
		  team's performance, not to the development of the product.
		  Working with the manager of each team, I helped implement
		  processes that would improve performance.  I also spent a great
		  deal of my time mentoring development members.  As I tried to
		  work by example, I took on a development load of between
		  50% and 100% (depending on how many administrative tasks the manager
		  wanted to download onto me).  In order to track performance, I
		  generally compiled weekly metrics showing our development
		  improvements.

	    <p>Projects:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li class="project">
		    Corel SVG Viewer.  Developed in C++ on Windows using
		    agile techniques (unit testing, refactoring, pair
		    programming).  I developed most of the underlying object model
		    for the code and helped refactor the SVG DOM engine.
		  </li>
		  <li class="project">
		    Corel Graphigo.  A sketching tool with automatic
			shape recognition written for Tablet PCs.  Written in C# and
			C++.  This project used a full blown Extreme Programming
			process.  We went from nothing to ~80,000 lines of code in 5
			months with between 4 and 6 programmers.  When it was
			shipped, there were only 12 bugs logged.  This product
			received the Comdex Best of Show award when it was released.
		  </li>
		  <li class="project">
		    Smart Graphics Studio.  A product used to visualise
		    data.  The user draws representations of the final output
		    using an SVG drawing tool.  He then indicates areas of the
			graphic that are to be "dynamic".  These dynamic areas are
			mapped to data.  An XSLT code generator is used to generate
			transformations from the data to the picture.  A widget
			library written in JavaScript is used to provide interactivity
			to the resultant project.  Developed in C++, XSLT and
			JavaScript this was a complex project involving 20 developers
			and 20 other staff.  Development was done using a variant of
			the SCRUM methodology.

          In this role, I actively took part in feature and code
          change reviews.  As part of my role I introduced a process

          changes within the group.

          I designed and implemented two features.  The first reduced

          feature was Release Link Trunk for PRI.  This feature
          reduced the utilisation of trunks during certain types of
          forwarded calls.  These features were implemented in
          Protel-2 and XPM-Pascal.
