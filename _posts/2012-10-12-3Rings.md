description: The three main aspects of programming
category: Style
summary: In this post I discuss the three main aspects of programming that I value most.  These aspects are described as a set of 3 concentric circles with the center circle being the most basic and the outer circle being most advanced.  This is an overview over and I will defer discussion of specific techniques to another time.

## What Is Important In Programming?

### The first circle: Solving problems

The essence of computer programming is the encoding of a solution
to a problem in a series of instructions that a computer can
understand and follow. If you do this, you are programming a computer.
It is the most basic and important part of programming.  There
are three stages of solving a problem:

1. Identifying the problem:  If the problem is poorly understood
    or incorrecly identified, the job can not be completed.

2. Encoding the solution:  If the computer does not have code that
can be executed, the problem isn't solved.

3. Verifying the solution: If the encoded solution does not solve
the problem, then the job is not finished.

This first circle is the absolute minimum that must be done in order
to say that a programming job is complete.  Beginning programmers
often feel this is all that must be done and spend all of their attention
in this circle.  Because all of the business value of a job appears
to lie in this circle, management often mistakenly encourages
programmers not to stray from this circle.

### The second circle: Communicating to humans

Almost every problem that is being solved by computers today is easy
to solve.  There are exceptions, of course, which contain complex
math or naturally mind bending logic.  Even with these exceptions,
the vast majority of the code complexity lies in the expression
of the code, not in the solution of the problem.
In other words, as we solve more and more problems with our code,
the complexity of navigating the code quickly outstrips the
complexity of solving the problems.

In the second circle, we are not only interested in the correct
solution of the problem.  It is not enough to make the computer
understand what the code is doing.  We must also make sure that
the next programmer understands it quickly and easily too.  There
are three ways to achieve this, which I have ordered by increasing
value (and, unfortunately, difficulty of production):

1. Separate Documentation: Usually written by programmers or
analysts, these documents are designed to help other programmers
navigate and understand key points of the code.

2. Integrated Documentation. Written by programmers, these are
usually comments or Javadoc style notations. This also includes
documents automatically generated from the code like those
produced by Doxygen.

3. Implied Documentation.  This is not documentation in the true
sense, but rather self documenting code.  Careful design coupled
with intelligent naming can lead to code that requires little or
no separate documentation to understand.  So-called unit tests,
or behavioral tests can also be used for this kind of documentation.

### The third circle: Simplification
