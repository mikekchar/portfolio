h1. Programming Ideas

This is my programming blog/portfolio.  

h2. Licensing

Licensing is a very difficult topic.  As this is my own personal portfolio,
I will only place my own content here.  The content is hereby placed under a
"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License":http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ !http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/3.0/88x31.png!

I will frequently embed code from other projects into this portfolio.  
The code snippets I embed will be covered by the creative commons license, 
no matter what the original license was.  However, this does not imply a 
change in the license of the original code.  As I said, I will only post 
my own code here, and since I hold the copyright, I will dual license those 
snippets only.  If you wish to use the content of my portfolio, or of any of 
my projects under different terms, please contact me.  In most cases I will
be happy to provide other options.
