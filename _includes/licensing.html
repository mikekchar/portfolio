<h2>Licensing</h2>
<p>Licensing is a very difficult topic.  As this is my own 
personal portfolio, I will only place my own content here.</p>

<p>As you can see at the bottom of this page, the contents of
this site are under a Creative Commons license.</p>
<p>I will frequently embed code from other projects into this 
portfolio.  The code snippets I embed will be covered by the 
creative commons license, no matter what the original license was.  
However, this does not imply a change in the license of the 
original code.  As I said, I will only post my own code here, 
and since I hold the copyright, I will dual license those 
snippets only.  If you wish to use the content of my portfolio, 
or of any of my projects under different terms, please contact me.  
In most cases I will be happy to provide other options.</p>
